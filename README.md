# agro_assistant

`agro_assistant` is a small utility project intended to support basic data processing tasks related to agriculture and field observations. The repository currently contains an initial project structure and will be expanded as development continues.

## Overview

The goal of the project is to provide a simple and organized place for helper functions, basic processing utilities, and scripts used in agricultural data workflows. Future updates may include additional modules for:

- field data handling
- basic crop and environmental parameter analysis
- integrations with external data sources

At this stage, the project serves as a foundation for further development.
